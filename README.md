# sometiles
My senior project from Kean University

## What?
This is a JS client for my tile-based GAME of random rules and mechanics. 

Right now it's a bit rough, but we almost have Checkers! 
Once all conditions are in place for Checkers, the netcode will be put in place using a simple Checkers game as a test.

##Future Work
Fun Mechanics like D20 Saving Throws, swordplay, and more! Gotta start with gameplay basics first though!
UI updates past nude DIVs in HTML. Gotta dress 'em up!
Stop using so many ! to end sentences!
