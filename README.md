# sometiles
My senior project from Kean University

## What?
This is a JS client for my tile-based GAME of random rules and mechanics. 


## In this build...
A late-alpha Checkers demo is the default rule setting in the current build, for time-semester-crunch reasons. [Alas, no Kings & no double-jumping... yet.]
Further, a base level of netcode room-joining is in place.

Right now the crunch is focusing on gameplay interactions between clients using Game State objects.


##Future Work
Fantastic stochastic mechanics like *D20 saving throws*, **swordplay**, environmental effects (e.g. trap tiles) and more! Gotta start with gameplay basics first though!

More efficient Web Socketry to increase scalability.
